#### Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?
Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got `very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round and looked at the man and` the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.

`'It's none of your business!' the young said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'`
